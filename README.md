# BookScoutSearch
A webpage that lets you compare buy and sell prices of books from different vendors.

This webpage was created by me for my team's project for UGA Hacks 2015. The webpage takes an ISBN as an argument, which can be supplied in the search field. Then, the page uses the BookScouter API and Amazon API to get book information, as well as available buying and selling prices from various online vendors, sorted in decreasing order of profit. Using BookScouter's API and Google Charts API, the page also shows the available history for the book, both of its popularity and average selling price. These graphs can show you when a book might be more popular and more expensive, so you can plan when to buy or sell for maximum profit.
Currently, this page is not uploaded to a server, so if you want to test it out, you need to download it and either upload it to your own server, or use xampp to simulate one on your local machine.
